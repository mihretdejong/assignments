                  OneZero: Recently we saw people on social media get dragged for taking selfies at Chernobyl. What is behind the impulse to shame people who take a lot of selfies, or who take selfies at places where we think it inappropriate?
                  Nathan Jurgenson: One of the things that dominate popular discussions about photography today is the impulse to shame. To start with the obvious: Camera phones are fairly recent and incredibly ubiquitous additions to our social landscape. They rearrange our environments and behaviors, and our norms and etiquette are trying to catch up. People can be annoying or rude or harmful with anything, so, yes, rude people are rude with their phones. But we should also ask, what behaviors are the social platforms incentivizing? So much social media is designed to operate like a game to maximize scores.

                  The Chernobyl-selfie thing seems overhyped, but we can think of other examples of behavior people get upset about: treating yourself as a “brand,” treating other people and the world as mere fodder for growing that brand, forcing the rest of us to see such obvious marketing within spaces that could otherwise be used differently (talking to friends and family, for example). Metricized platforms encourage seeing your self, your experiences, and your world not in and of themselves but to be put to work, to be made productive. But I would hesitate to lump taking selfies in with these antisocial behaviors.

                  “I think the breathless cries of ‘narcissism’ around selfies says more about those commentators than the selfie-takers.”
                   Perhaps we like to think that identity just happens, that our selves are “authentic,” and so seeing someone pose and perform for the screen makes us a bit insecure about our own social performances. In any case, I think the breathless cries of “narcissism” around selfies says more about those commentators than the selfie-takers.
